# User Guide and Content Description

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive user guide and content description for the R scripts: `app.R` and `data_clean.R`. These scripts are essential components of the project and are responsible for data cleaning and application execution, respectively.

## Description of `app.R`

The `app.R` script serves as the main entry point for the application. This script is responsible for [briefly describe what the script does, e.g., launching a Shiny app, performing analysis, etc.].

### Key Components

- **UI Definition**: The script defines the user interface (UI) of the application using the `fluidPage()` function, which includes [describe the elements like inputs, outputs, layout, etc.].
  
- **Server Logic**: The server function contains the core logic of the application, which includes [mention any data processing, plotting, reactive expressions, etc.].

- **Application Launch**: Finally, the `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` function is called to launch the application.

### Dependencies

The script depends on several R packages such as `shiny`, `dplyr`, etc. Ensure these packages are installed before running the script.

## Description of `data_clean.R`

The `data_clean.R` script is responsible for preparing and cleaning the dataset. It performs tasks such as [describe the tasks, e.g., data transformation, filtering, handling missing values, etc.].

### Key Functions

- **Data Loading**: The script loads the data using `read.csv()` or similar functions.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: The cleaning process involves [describe key cleaning steps such as removing duplicates, filtering rows, etc.].

- **Output**: The cleaned dataset is saved or passed to the next step in the pipeline.

### Dependencies

This script requires packages such as `tidyverse`, `data.table`, etc. Ensure these packages are installed before running the script.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure that the following packages are installed:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "tidyverse"))
