## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the interactive and customizable features of our Shiny application, designed to facilitate dynamic analysis of clinical trial data. It highlights how users can interact with and customize the application to suit their analysis needs.

## Application Overview

The application is designed to be highly interactive, with several components that allow users to dynamically manipulate data visualizations and statistical outputs. Here’s a breakdown of its key features:

### User Interface Components

#### Measurement Selection
Users can select from various measurements like Glucose, C-peptide, or an Index for detailed analysis. This choice affects the types of visualizations and statistical summaries presented.

#### Visualization Options
The application offers options to view data in pooled or individual formats. This feature helps users compare different datasets or focus on specific data points within the same dataset.

### Dynamic Outputs

#### Plots and Tables
Depending on the user’s choices of measurements and visualization types, the application dynamically generates relevant plots and tables. This ensures that the outputs are tailored to the user's current analytical focus.

### Conditional Panels
Certain features and input options are displayed conditionally, based on previous selections. This approach helps maintain a clean and relevant user interface, preventing clutter and enhancing usability.

## Customization Options

### Theme Customization
Users have the ability to customize the visual theme of the application. Options might include default, dark mode, or light mode, each providing a different visual experience that can be chosen according to user preference.

### Data Filtering
Interactive sliders and selection boxes allow users to filter the dataset based on specific parameters, such as time frames or specific values. This feature is crucial for drilling down into more granular data insights.

## Conclusion

The described features demonstrate the application's flexibility and user-focused design, providing a powerful tool for data analysis with extensive customization options. The application is continually refined to enhance its functionality and ease of use based on user feedback.
